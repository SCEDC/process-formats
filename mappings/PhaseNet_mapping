This is a mapping for the PhaseNet csv output to json phase pick format.

    {
      "Type"      : "Pick",
      "Site"      :
      {
         "Station"   : String,
         "Channel"   : String,
         "Network"   : String,
         "Location"  : String
      },
      "Time"      : phase_time, #format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ
      "Source"    :
      {
         "AgencyID"  : "CI",
         "Author"    : "hypoPN"
      },
      "Phase"     : phase_type,
      "Polarity"  : ("up" | "down" | "no-result"),
      "Picker"    : "deep-learning",
      "Filter"    : [ {
        "Type"     : "HighPass",
        "HighPass" : Number,
        }]
      "Amplitude" :
      {
         "Amplitude" : phase_amp,
         "SNR"       : phase_snr_db
      },
      "Quality" : [ {
        "Standard"     : "PhaseNet",
        "Value"    : phase_score
        }]
    }


* Notes:
- For Site, the components will come from station_id which has the form network.station.location.channel
- For Polarity, the info is in phase_polarity; however, the values are different than those allowed in the json format, so a conversion will be necessary ("U" -> "up", "D" -> "down"). For "-", we will map to "no-result".
- For Picker, when using phasenet picks - use value "deep-learning".
- For Filter, PN uses a highpass filter with a value passed in as an initial argument, if the value passed is >0 (default). See data_reader.py & predict.py.
